# D3 v4 Sortable

gh-pages [demo](https://shanegibney.github.io/d3-v4-sortable-table/)

This table is created using a JSON object. Some keys have string values and the others have numerical values.

The sorting is different for each type. Therefore you need to specify which columns are strings and need to be sorted alphabetically.
